# API

## Description
 * Design an API to manage a job board. This can include descriptions of endpoints, requests, responses 
 * or anything else that will help us understand your design, but please don’t write any code. 
 * 
 * The API should satisfy the following requirements:
    ● Jobs postings should have at least a title and description
    ● Users can create job postings
    ● Users can update job postings
    ● Users can read a specific job posting
    ● Users read multiple job postings, optionally filtering by title
    ● Users can delete job postings

## Models

```ts
type JobPosting {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    description: String!
}
```
